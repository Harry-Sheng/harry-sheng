ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I am Harry Sheng, currently a second year student at the University of Auckland, pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science.

ðŸ”­ I am broadly interested in machine learning and constantly explore how this technology can be used to create a positive societal impact. My goal is to ensure that the advancements in AI technology lead to a positive impact on society. Currently, my research focuses on AI safety. Specifically, I want to better understand the vulnerabilities in visual language models and design effective strategies to enhance their safety.

âš¡ Fun fact: In my free time, I enjoy going to the gym and doing some powerlifting stuff. My current PB is squat 200kg, bench 110kg, and deadlift 220kg. :)
